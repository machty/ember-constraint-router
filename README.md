# ember-constraint-router

**Note: Very Very Alpha**

This probably shouldn't be called "constraint-router" any more, at least
not until I reintroduce the concepts of constraints.

The current focus is landing an Ember-equivalent API of
[React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/) library, which is a
robust, battle-tested, and well designed navigation solution.
